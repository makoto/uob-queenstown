## Project Overview

This is an academic research project investigating **perceived liveability in Singapore's Queenstown district**. The goal is to connect subjective perceptions of liveability with objective spatial indicators and translate findings into planning insights.

## Study Focus

- **Study area:** Queenstown (assigned to this group; other groups cover Bishan, Outram, Tampines, Newton)
- **Spatial boundary:** Must be defined from the URA Master Plan

## Research Framework

Two dimensions to investigate:
1. **Subjective:** How people perceive and feel about liveability in Queenstown
2. **Objective (pick ≥2):** Social intensity (POIs), accessibility (street/transit/green-blue networks), active mobility (walking/cycling), microclimate (weather), public facilities (amenities/services)

## Key Data Sources

- Open data: https://data.gov.sg/
- URA Map platform: https://eservice.ura.gov.sg/maps/
- OneMap (including 3D): https://www.onemap.gov.sg/
- Master Plan: https://www.uradraftmasterplan.gov.sg/regional-plans/
- Transport data: https://datamall.lta.gov.sg/content/datamall/en.html
- Street view imagery: https://www.mapillary.com/app

## Deliverables

1. A **geospatial map** showing distribution of perceived liveability and selected urban factors
2. A **report with analysis** (~1000 words)
